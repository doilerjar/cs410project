Her heart works with help of the car engine and itâ€™s you who decide how much time she has.
And it depends on you how many neon landscapes she will see - the road to the sky has no end in the last trip. 

The endless world in Retrowawe setting where you'll burn tyres of the car to the strongest tracks of Retowawe/Synthwawe composers. 
Neon landscapes with mountain chains and beaches will be your companions in the fated race. 

If the car engine stops working, she will die and her blood will be on your hands! 

Experience the atmosphere of the world inspired by 80s with their neon lights, VHS tapes and synth pop. Buckle up!
