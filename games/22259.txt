Scram Kitty and His Buddy on Rails
Scram Kitty and his Buddy on Rails is a frenetic action platform game with unique controls and a striking visual style. An experiment has gone horribly wrong, and the Council of Great Scientists has been overrun by the intelligent, power-crazed lab rats and mice they’ve accidentally created! This rodent army has already taken control of the space station, and is now hell-bent on taking over Planet Earth. In order to do that, of course, they first plan to get rid of their eternal enemies, the one thing that has always stood in their way -- cats! There’s nothing else for it, you’re going to have to grab your anti-grav spinboard, get up to that space lab, defeat the super-rodent menace and find Scram Kitty!
