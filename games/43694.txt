World Destruction League: War Jetz
In a world torn apart by nuclear war, the most popular form of entertainment is WORLD DESTRUCTION LEAGUE: WarJetz. You can get behind the controls of nine different aircraft, including the nimble Dragonfly helicopter and the massive Marauder II bomber. After you pick a vehicle you can engage in six modes of competition: Ace, Airlord, Bomb Fest, Air Wars, Family Ace, and Cash Frenzy. All of the modes can be played against computer-controlled opponents or a friend. No matter who you play against it is important to collect the MegaNuke, cluster bombs, homing missiles, air mines, and other weapons that are scattered in the eight different arenas. Do you have what it takes to become a top ace in WORLD DESTRUCTION LEAGUE: WarJetz?
