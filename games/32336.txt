ERISLE
is an ARPG created with the Unity5 game engine by an independent team.   
  
It combines currency and health into the same value to create unique changes in numbers and a brand new gaming experience.   
 
We made a bold decision in designing the game’s stats system, where a player’s Shield (powered by energy),Ammunition and in-game currency are all represented by the same number, which is called “Energy” in the game.
