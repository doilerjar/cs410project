Shadowhand
ShadowHand is a unique, card-battling adventure game, coming to Steam for PC & Mac. 
 
Set in late 18th Century England, we follow the story of Lady Darkmoor, a beguiling young aristocrat who masquerades as the notorious highwaywoman, ShadowHand. Fleeing a crime scene and forced to act under the cover of darkness, Shadowhand will stop at nothing to retrieve an incriminating family jewel, and in doing so, safeguard a woman she holds dear. 
 
Combining an historical visual novel narrative with collectible card gaming, ShadowHand’s story spans 20 chapters of atmospheric locations including stormy coastlines, mysterious woods and gloomy manors. Featuring 180 levels of elegant and intense card action, players must dodge the law and brawl with outlaws in turn-based combat, gaining experience to customise their character and collect new weapons, gear and loot. 
 
It’s time to stand and deliver – your fortune and freedom are at stake!
