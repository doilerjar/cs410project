CEO Test
A nonlinear, story-driven game about corporate control. 
 
The Glazial Group is looking for a new CEO. We are currently developing the CEO Test to preselect potential candidates. This CEO Test will be released as a game, combining nonlinear storytelling with strategy-building elements to test potential applicants’ abilities to deal with economic complexity and emotional challenges. 
 
Apply for the position of CEO by playing the game once it is released. 
 
 
FEATURES: 
 
1. CORPORATE CONTROL 
 
You play the role of a newly elected CEO, leading the Glazial Group through a series of mergers and hostile takeovers. Control the conglomerate using the Gesicht software, which constantly tests and evaluates your decisions. 
 
MANAGE THE COMPANY: Acquire unique companies, start strange projects, hire (or, more amusingly, fire) hundreds of employees. 
 
MANAGE YOURSELF: Play with your emotions and defend your sanity as you negotiate through too many business meetings. 
 
GROW THE CONGLOMERATE: Expand your corporate empire into the weakened European market. 
 
 
2. A NONLINEAR STORY 
 
Economic systems and humans are difficult to predict, so our CEO Test reflects that reality with nonlinear storytelling. Whether you grab for personal wealth, advance the interests of the company or work with unions – it’s all up to you. 
 
EARLY STORY BRANCHING: Even the very first conversation in the game can alter the plot dramatically. 
 
REPLAYABILITY: Your choices affect the game’s economic system, the fate of individual characters, even the genre of the story and the kind of game you’re playing. 
 
SENSITIVE: Gameplay and story are tightly interwoven. From drinking a cup of tea to acquiring a giant technology firm – every action can have an impact.
