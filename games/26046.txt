Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Atlas Gorge Multiplayer Map
The Call of Duty®: Advanced Warfare Atlas Gorge Bonus Multiplayer map re-envisions the fan-favorite The Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare® map Pipeline. The Atlas Corporation has commandeered the world’s largest power source, the Three Gorges Dam in central China, whose sinister backdrop creates a gripping setting for multiplayer battle. Combatants will navigate the shadows, explore the map’s new verticality empowered by exoskeleton technology, and control a map-based turret scorestreak that overlooks the dam and helps to keep enemies at bay.
