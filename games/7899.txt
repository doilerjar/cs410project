Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide
Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide offers role playing fans even more D&D features than the ground breaking original.

Additions include new skills, including Tumble and Appraise; new feats, such as Divine Might, Extra Music and Bullheaded; new weapons, such as Holy Water Flasks
and Choking Powder; new prestige classes, like Harper Scout; new monsters from the D&D universe, including Medusa, Cockatrice, Sphinx, and Female Fire Giant;
and dozens of new spells.

In addition, the expansion pack equips amateur module makers with additional content for the Neverwinter Nights Aurora Toolset, the groundbreaking software 
included with the full game that allows players to create their own universes, quests and storylines.

The toolset will be augmented with all new tile sets for creation of new environments as well as new "Wizards" or automated guides, to help gamers build and play adventures of their own creation.
