Robinson's Requiem
You play one of these Robinsons who gets stranded on a mysterious alien planet on which a telepathic woman is also stranded. As it turns out she knows a way to get off the planet, but she needs your help to escape. 
 
Gameplay consists of first person roleplaying with the emphasis placed on character modeling and survival. Take a dip when it's cold and you'll sure catch the flu, don't treat an infected injury and amputation is on the way, etc. You must fashion your own tools from whatever you can find on the planet and the game uses pre-rendered sprites over voxel technology terrain for graphics.
