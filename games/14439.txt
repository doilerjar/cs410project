Tunneler
Tunneler is the better known game by Geoffrey Silverton (the other one is Popgames). Two players using the same keyboard and the same screen each control an underground tank. Goal is to find and destroy the opponent's tank. Since only small part of the map is displayed on the split screen, you might actually have some searching to do.
