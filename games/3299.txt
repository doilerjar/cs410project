Just Dance Kids
A dancing game designed for kids, with simpler choreography for their minds to handle and oh-so-punchable on-screen dancers for them to relate to. If the real games are anything to go by, this also does not contain the Lady GaGa song "Just Dance", which the franchise is named after.
