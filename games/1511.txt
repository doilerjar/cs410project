Pokémon Blue
Pokémon Red and Blue Versions offer a JRPG experience in which you capture and "evolve" your team of monsters by training them to higher levels. Choose one of 3 starter Pokémon and embark on a quest to catch them all - including the fabled legendary beasts -, take down a crime organization, overcome your rival, challenge 8 different Pokémon Gyms and defeat the Elite Four to become the ultimate Pokémon Master.
