Muv-Luv
Muv-Luv is a Japanese visual novel originally released as an adult game and the first game in the Muv-Luv franchise. Subsequent releases of the games were with the adult content removed. The game consists of two parts: Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited, which is unlocked after completing the two main heroine routes in Extra. The gameplay in Muv-Luv follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the differing scenarios of the female main characters. A Kickstarter campaign to release the Muv-Luv series in English has been announced.
