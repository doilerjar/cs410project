Airborne Troops: Countdown to D-Day
It's 48 hours before the D-day invasion of Normandy. You are John Welsh, an elite paratrooper dropped behind enemy lines to complete missions crucial to the success of the invasion. You must avoid detection, organize the resistance fighters, and destroy key targets relying only on your wits and elite training. You must succeed at all costs. Failure is not an option. And so begins Airborne Troops, where stealth, intelligence, courage, and deadly aim win the day. Explore historically authentic locations, while using realistic weapons as you draw on your skills with knives, pistols, rifles, machine guns, and even panzerschrecks to dispatch your enemies in almost a dozen levels of World War II destruction.
