A career mode is included to let you earn money to upgrade your car and move up through three different classes of the Viper racing league. Many tracks are included, along with replays, for reviewing races later, and a garage mode, for tweaking your setup.  There are also hacks, including the ability to drive planes, but none of these are particularly useful, nor well-polished, except the 'exotic' car. (Most of the vehicle models are incomplete). Viper Racing's physics were very advanced for its time, and the AI, when set to hard, can even get into car-fights with you!
46830 Final Lap Final Lap is a racing video game produced by Namco,[2] and released by Atari Games for the United States in 1987. It was the first game to run on Namco's then new System 2 hardware, and is a direct successor to Namco's two earlier Pole Position games (1982-1983).  Final Lap was the first racing game to allow up to eight players to simultaneously race on the Suzuka Circuit, in a Formula One race. This was, at the time, considered a revolutionary feature and was implemented by linking together up to four two-player sitdown-style arcade cabinets.[2][3] It was also arguably the first racing game to implement "rubber banding" to ensure that less talented players were never too far behind the leader, a concept that would be taken much further by the Mario Kart series.[3] There was also a single player mode, in which the player's score was based on how far the car travelled until time ran out or if the player completed four laps (on default settings; the arcade operator can set the lap number to be as low as three or as high as six).

42595 Front Mission: Gun Hazard The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...  Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.  Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.

6822 Pac-Land Pac-Land itself is split into trips. In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.  The penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.  As in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.

11126 Armor Ambush Armor Ambush is a game that gives players control over tanks that battle one another over terrain that offers varying degrees of texture and traversability. Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise. However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of Combat. The field of battle occupies a region greater than the size of the screen. Additionally, players can drop mines on the battlefield by simultaneously pressing the fire button and pulling down on the joystick. The mines remain active for the duration of the battle, destroying either tank that runs over them. Players are able to control two tanks and switch between them on command. The terrain is more diverse, featuring areas of foliage, water, and natural barriers. There is also a single-player mode that allows a player to battle a computer-controlled opponent.

46908 Microgammon SB Microgammon SB originally started out as an Apple IIe game. According to programmer Steve Baker, he had originally developed the game for the Apple when he decided to port it to the Atari 5200.

However one side effect of using the 5200's high-res mode was that the graphics were in black & white only. However most players find that this really doesn't distract much from the game since it uses black and white pieces anyway.

11764 The Plan A fly ascends to the skies, pondering the pointlessness of its brief existence. The Plan was developed as a side project by Krillbite Studio, who's currently finishing their main project Among the Sleep."Hey, You Should Play This" - Patrick Klepek, Giantbomb"Some may argue that The Plan isn't really a game and it definitely occupies the same terrain as Journey, Passage, and Dear Esther, but it's shorter than Journey, prettier than Passage, and less overwrought than Dear Esther, making it well worth taking a punt on for the low price of free." - Jeffrey Matulef, Eurogamer"It’s that space in the mechanics for thought and interpretation that I appreciate most here. The Plan won’t break your brain, but it’s a nicely contemplative journey." - Nathan Grayson, RockPaperShotgun"In order, here are the emotions I experienced during the three minutes it took me to play The Plan, the new free morsel from the Norweigan indie developer Krillbite: confusion, frustration, boredom, fear, amusement, delight, joy, enchantment, and regret. One of the things independent games ask us to do is accept that a three-minute game can be as valid as a thirty-hour one. Games like these make it hard to disagree." - Joseph Bernstein, Buzzfeed"Krillbite Studio, the developers behind Among The Sleep, have gone on and released a most polished, visually stunning and freeware new game" - Konstantinos Dimopoulos, Indiegames.com"Krillbite's The Plan is a short, sharp experimental deliberation on the meaning of life." - Andy Chalk, The Escapist

42378 Ball Bullet Gun: Survival Game Simulation A turn-based strategy game based on paintball simulation battles.  Ball Bullet Gun: Survival Game Simulation is a Japan-exclusive turn-based strategy game for the Super Famicom. The game allows the player to create a party of "soldiers", though the implication is that these are regular civilians taking part in a military simulation, and determine their names, faces and loadouts. The player then takes this team through a series of missions, using whichever members best fit the criteria.  The game makes heavy use of fog of war, making it impossible to see the enemy's team unless they get within visual range. The player characters can use cover and change the direction they're facing, which allows them to get the drop on enemies. Everything - movement and reloading or shooting a weapon - requires a finite number of "AP" that replenishes after each turn. Both sides take turns to be the remaining team on the field.

11658 Yo-Kai Watch 2: Bony Spirits Much like its predecessor, Yo-kai Watch 2 is an open world role-playing video game, where the player is given control of player character Nathan Adams, or alternatively, Katie Forester. Players navigate around the open world using the Nintendo 3DS' touchscreen to find and befriend various Yo-kai, which are scattered across the overworld. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. A new feature in battles is using the touch screen to find a particular sweetspot on an enemy Yo-kai to increase the likelihood of befriending it at the end of the battle, or other sweetspots for extra damage, extra money, or extra experience. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Crank-a-kai (Gasha Machine) by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game's main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended. When the player encounters a Yo-kai, he enters into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player's Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai's Soultimate abilities. While the original Yo-kai Watch featured nearly 250 Yo-kai, Yo-Kai Watch 2 features nearly 450, including several that were featured as bosses in the original game.

25728 Tarzan According to African legend, a human baby was abandoned in the forest. Found and brought up by a she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.  Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther.  After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand.  Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them.  If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.

Players follow in his footsteps, surviving in the woods by finding food and fuel and maintaining their shelter and clothing. At the same time, players are surrounded by the beauty of the woods and the Pond, which hold a promise of a sublime life beyond these basic needs. The game follows the loose narrative of Thoreau’s first year in the woods, with each season holding its own challenges for survival and possibilities for inspiration.   The audience for the game is broad: from experimental game players to lovers of Thoreau and Transcendental literature. As such, the game offers more opportunities for reflective play than strategic challenge. The piece has a subtle narrative arc, in homage to the original text, which is not an adventure of the body pitted against nature, but of the mind and soul living in nature over the course of a New England year.   We have just opened a quiet early access alpha on Itch.io if you'd like to play now and give feedback. For those of you asking why we haven't updated this site in a while ... well, we've been very busy building a six-hour open world game with a tiny team of developers!

24015 Quick Step Quick Step! is a unique take on the Q*Bert formula by adding two player action and a more frantic pace. You are a kangaroo who loves to paint trampolines green. However, a squirrel likes to paint them blue. Naturally, this can result in some hectic competition between the two. Jumping on one of the trampolines will turn it the color of your character and earn you points. During the game the trampolines scroll down to the bottom of the screen before they disappear. Naturally, you must avoid being on a trampoline when it disappears, otherwise you will lose a life.  Occasionally, you may find a special square that will cause your character to flash. If you jump onto a trampoline where the other character is, they will be stunned briefly, giving you an opportunity to make them lose a life. What is truly unique is how the computer player also has a limited number of lives just like the human player does. After one player loses all of their lives, the other player is awarded extra points for his or her remaining lives. If you want to get big points, you have to adopt a different strategy to avoid having your opponent lose all their lives. Truly a unique and fun experience, although the game can be frustrating to play against the computer as you'll find it easy to stay alive longer than the computer.

746 High Heat Baseball 2000 High Heat Major League Baseball was a series of baseball computer games, released on PlayStation, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC. There were six annual versions of the game released, started with High Heat Baseball 1999, and ending with High Heat Major League Baseball 2004.[1]  The game, featuring the official licensed team and player names from all 30 MLB teams, was created by games company 3DO which subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2003 soon after the release of the final version of the series, High Heat Major League Baseball 2004. In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO, however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.[2]  High Heat was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors World Series Baseball, All Star Baseball, or Triple Play Baseball, but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality. At the core of High Heat′s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.[3]

45821 Fighters Mega Mix Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter. The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.  In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers. Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2. Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.  Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult. But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options. The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay. Other options are unlockable while playing the game.  One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters. Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers.

45065 Tennis Arena With no stat tweaking and no licenses, Tennis Arena is arcade-style tennis at its most fundamental.  What you have here is single-match or tournament play for up to four players with wacky characters and a few different courts to play on.

No sim, Tennis Arena serves up roughly the same level of fun as Pong did 25 years ago, albeit now with prettier graphics and the occasional super smash.  The game also features special shots, with visible trails, fighter-plane-like sound effects, and higher ball speed. These must be earned however. After successfully returning the ball over the net six consecutive times, a yellow star appears under the character. You may then attempt to use the special shot, which entails lining up with the ball just right - but a failed special shot doesn't erase the stored potential.
