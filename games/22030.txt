Soulcalibur: Lost Swords
Soulcalibur: Lost Swords was a free-to-play fighting game distributed through PlayStation Network. Released in 2014, the game is based on Soulcalibur V and is strictly single-player. It uses the same weapon-based fighting system from previous games; however, several of the gameplay mechanics are changed, simplified or otherwise removed. Similar to other free-to-play titles like Tekken Revolution, microtransactions are offered, some of which remove the playtime limit of the game. The game is also periodically updated with new content, including new events, items, and characters.

The game ceased operations effective on November 30, 2015, as per an announcement on September 1, 2015
